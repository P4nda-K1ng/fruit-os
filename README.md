# fruit-os
This is a new repository for an operating system, which I have given the name (for now) Fruit OS. 
The repository here contains (as of April 25th 2020) parts of the kernel. 
For now, until I or someone else makes a bootloader, use GRUB to boot the kernel.
Since I am not a very skilled programmer, any contribution to this project will help a lot. Please tell me if the kernel doesn't work.
Thank you!
